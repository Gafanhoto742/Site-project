        <h2>Does the astronauts leaves the ISS?</h2>
        <p>Astronauts on the International Space Station ever get a full day off work. In addition one or two of the astronauts may have to perform a few activities that are required for either vehicle safety or payload success. The rest of the day is free.</p>

        <h2>How does the astronauts live inside of the ISS?</h2>
        <p>Even on the International Space Station (the ISS), astronauts need to carry out personal hygiene.
            <p>In such a small space that you have to share with up to 13 people at times. The astronauts have to strap themselves in to prevent floating off.</p> Instead of a flush toilet there is a suction tube which carries the waste away in an air stream
            down a hole. The solid gets compressed and stored for disposal later. The urine is connected and later recycled. The food is specially prepared because weightlessness requires adjustments to prevent the food from floating off a plate. Some
            types of food must also be eaten to counter the effects of adaptation to the space environment.</p>
